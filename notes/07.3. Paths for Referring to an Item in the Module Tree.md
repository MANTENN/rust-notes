# Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

Problem it solves:
    - call an item in a module

## Main Idea

- `absolute` starts from crate root, or a literal `crate`
- `relative` starts from current module
  - `self`, `super`, or an identifier to refer in the current module

- paths are seperated by `::`
- items(functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) in modules are `private` by default

`Items in a parent module canâ€™t use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules.`

you can expose inner parts of child modules code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an **item** public.


## Structs and Enums

use `pub` before `struct`, and `enum` definitions

- in structs items remain `private`, where as in enums items become `public`
