# Defining and Instantiating Structs

can contain different named--unlike tuples--types

## Defining

defined with `struct` seperated with a space and then followed by a name, and `{` and `}`. Inside the struct's body, declare _fields_ using `key: value` pairs;
ex:

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
}
```

## Creating an Instance

use the structs name followed by `{}`, inside the `{}` define each field's value.

ex:

```rust
let user1 = User {
    username: "Nazar",
    email: "nazar@gmail.com",
    active: true,s
}
```

to grab a value use the dot notation; to grab an email, from the user object it would be: `user1.email`

if the instance is mutable, values can be changed using the dot notation

can implicitly return the newly constructed instance like any expression

map parameters to structs keys

### Field Init Shorthand

- variables and field names need to have the same name
- omit value like in JavaScript when assigning variable names as properties

ex

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

### Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax

_Struct Update Syntax_ grabs non specified values from the specified struct instance

Create with values from other instances without _update syntax_

- granular/provides control

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    active: user1.active,
    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

- provides productivity

> The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

ex

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    ..user1
};
```

### Tuple Structs

named tuples without named keys
its own type
behave like tuples

> To define a tuple struct, start with the `struct` keyword and the struct name followed by the types in the tuple.

ex

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
```

### Unit-Like Structs

structs without fields
behave similarly to `()`--the unit type

useful when

> you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type itself.

ex `struct Food();`

## Ownership

- non referenced values are owned by the struct, and are valid as long as the struct is valid
- referenced values require use of _lifetimes_--ensure the values are valid as long as the struct is

> Using `String` ensures the struct owns all of its data, and it'll be valid as long as the struct is valid.
> It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_
>
> Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct is valid for as long as the struct is.

## Methods

- similiar to functions
- defined within the struct(enum, or trait object) context, first parameter is `self`
  - need to use `&` to reuse variable outside again
- use _method syntax_ to call them
  defined within Structs context: `impl <StructName> {}`
  - can be declared multiple times
- inside the body define methods

- organized code, one place to grab functions

ex:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.height * self.width
    }
}
```

### Where’s the -> Operator

> In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: you use . if you’re calling a method on the object directly and -> if you’re calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the pointer first. In other words, if `object` is a pointer, `object->something()` is similar to `(*object).something()`.
>
> Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the `->` operator; instead, Rust has a feature called _automatic referencing and dereferencing_. Calling methods is one of the few places in Rust that has this behavior.
>
> ```
> p1.distance(&p2);
> (&p1).distance(&p2);
> ```
>
> The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works because methods have a clear receiver—the type of `self`. Given the receiver and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). The fact that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of making ownership ergonomic in practice.

### Additional Parameters

- passed like in normal functions

### Associated Functions

- dont take self as a parameter
- used for constructors
- called with `::`: `<Type>::methodName(<args>)`
  - also used by namespaces created by modules
