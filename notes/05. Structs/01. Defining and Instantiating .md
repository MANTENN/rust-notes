# Defining and Instantiating Structs

can contain different named--unlike tuples--types

## Defining

to define use `struct` seperated with a space followed by a name, and `{` and `}`. Inside the struct's body, declare *fields* using `key: value` pairs;
ex:

``` rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    active: bool,
}
```

## Creating an Instance

use the structs name followed by `{}`, inside the `{}` define each field's value.

ex:

``` rust
let user1 = User {
    username: "Nazar",
    email: "nazar@gmail.com",
    active: true,s
}
```
