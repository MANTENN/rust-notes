# `Structs`

> A struct, or structure, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s data attributes.

- custom data type, like an object
- group related data

> Structs and enums are the building blocks for creating new types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile time type checking.
