# The `Slice` type

does not have **ownership**

> Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

## `String` methods

- `as_bytes` method converts string to array of bytes
- `iter` returns each element in a collection
  - `enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as a tuple.
    - can destructure: `(i, &val)`

## String Slices

> _reference_ to a part of the string

created using brackets: `[start...end]`--end is exclusive; can ommit first, and/or end token when slicing, ie: `[..end]`, returns a refernce

## String Literals Are Slices

`let s = "Hello";` is `&str` type

## String Slices as Parameters

## Other Slices

`Array` works the same as `String` slice

## Summary

> The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory usage in the same way as other systems programming languages, but having the owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of scope means you donâ€™t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.
