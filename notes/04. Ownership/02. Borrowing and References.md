# References and Borrowing

## Borrowing

having references as parameters

`&` allow values to be _referenced_ without taking _ownership_

## Mutable References

- immutable inside functions they are passed to

rules:

- one mutable reference(`&mut`) without immutable references in the same scope
  - prevents data races
  - can use blocks to use the mutable reference in the same scope
  - referenced variable must be mutable

### Data Race

- two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
- atleast one of the pointers is being used to write of the data
- no mechanism used to synchronize data

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```

## Derefence

when function parameters accept values with `*` operator

## Dangling Pointers

> a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory

rust will throw an error while compiling preventing this error from happening

## Recap

Rules:

- > one mutable reference, or any number of immutable references.
- > References must always be valid.
