# References and Borrowing

`&` allow values to be referenced without taking ownership

## Mutable References

- immutable inside functions they are passed to
- one mutable reference(`&mut`) without immutable references in the same scope
    - prevents data races
    - can use blocks to use the mutable reference in the same scope
    - referenced variable must be mutable

data race is when:
- two or more pointers access the same data at the same time
- atleast one of the pointers is being used to write of the data
- no mechanism used to synchronize data

```
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");

    let len = calculate_length(&s1);

    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", s1, len);
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
> The opposite of referencing by using `&` is dereferencing, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`.

> having references as function parameters *borrowing*

## Dangling Pointers

>  a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been given to someone else, by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to that memory

rust will throw an error while compiling preventing this error from happening


## Recap

> At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
> References must always be valid.
