# What is Ownership?

System through which memory is managed in Rust is checked at compile time

Solves: tracking used data stored on heap, reducing duplicate data stored on heap, and removing unused data on heap

## Ownership Rules

> - Each value has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
> - There can only be one owner at a time.
> - When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable Scope

A scope is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Specified by the block the variable is declared in.

## The `String` type

- allocated on heap
- created with `from` method on `String`--`String::from("hello")`
  
> The double colon (`::`) is an operator that allows us to namespace this particular `from` function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like `string_from`.

### String Literal

- `String::new("");`
- immutable
- fast b\c size is known at compile time
- "hardcoded"

## Memory And Allocation

To allocate to string type:

- memory requested from OS
- way to return back to OS
