# Variables and Mutability

## Variables

Variables are by default, immutable.

Compiler will throw an error when a non immutable variable will be assigned a new value

Add `mut` before the variable name to make it mutable

### Tradeofs

- mutating may be quicker than returning new values

## Consts

- immutable forever
- declared by using `const`
- type must be annotated
- can be declared anywhere--ie: global, function, etc...
- can be set to a constant expression--no function calls, or computed values
- set them in one place

## Shadowing

a variable which reuses a name and has a new value assigned

- allows for temporary tranformations without making the variable mutable
- use `let <name>` to shadow previous value
  - can change the type
- creates a new variable, and assigns it the new value--`mut` does not do this

## Mutating

- variable must be marked as `mut`
- `<name> = <new-value>`
