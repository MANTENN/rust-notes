# Common Programming Concepts

Rust is reasonably similiar to other languages. Rust is an expression-based language.

## Keywords

Rust has its own set of special words reserved for use by the language

## Identifiers

- aka a name
- made up from non empty ASCII strings with exceptions:
  Either:
  -first char is a letter
  -remaining characters are alphanumeric or `_`
  Or:
  - first char is \_
  - identifier is more than one char--`_` is not an identifier
  - the remaining characters are alphanumeric or `_`

### Raw Identifiers

When you need to use a keyword for an another purpose--define a function with a reserved keyword, or call a function from an another language.
ex:

```rust
fn r#match(needle: &str, haystack: &str) -> bool {
    haystack.contains(needle)
}

```

define:

- start with `r#`
