# Common Programming Concepts

Rust is reasonably similiar to other languages.

## Keywords

Rust has its own set of special words reserved for use by the language

## Identifiers

- aka a name
- made up from non empty ASCII strings with exceptions:
Either:
  -first char is a letter
  -remaining characters are alphanumeric or `_`
Or:
  - first char is _
  - identifier is more than one char--`_` is not an identifier
  - the remaining characters are alphanumeric or `_`

### Raw Identifiers

When you need to use a keyword for an another purpose, or call a function from an another language.

- start with `r#`
