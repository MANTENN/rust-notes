# Datatypes

> Rust is a statically typed language.

Compiler infers what types to assign to values, and variables.

ex: `let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a variable");`

## Scalar

Represents a single value.

Four Scalar types in Rust:

- integers
- floating-point numbers
- Booleans
- chars

### Integers

whole number

can be:

- unsigned( positive or negative) or signed(safe to assume its positive)
  - Signed are stored as Two's Complements
- explicit size

#### Integer Overfow

changing a int based variable over its size

- debug mode: will cause a panic
- release mode: two's complement wrapping
  - `256` will become `0`
  - `257` will become `1`

ie: `u8` to `256` from `255`

> Relying on overflow is considered an error, even if this behavior happens. If you want this behavior explicitly, the standard library has a type, `Wrapping`, that provides it explicitly.

### Floating Points

fractions as decimals

- `f32`, and `f64` -- defaults to `f64`
- representation based on IEEE-754

### Numberic Operations

basic mathemtical operations for all numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder

```
let sum = 5 + 10;
let difference = 95.5 + 4.3;
let product = 4 * 30;
let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
let remainder = 43 % 5;
```

### Boolean

- true or false
- annotated as `bool`

### Character

- represent a unicode scalar value
- annotated as `char`
- contain a single character
- wrapped single quotes

### Compound

group multiple types into one

- tuples
- arrays

#### Tuple

- general approach
- fixed length--cannot grow or shrink
- created by `()`, each field type must be annotated, and value must be declared
- can be destructured by using pattern matching withing--`()`
- access elements with `.`
  - index beings with 0

ex:

``` rust
fn main() {
  // assigning types, and values
  let tup: (u8, i32, f64) = (5, -15, 10.5);
  //destructuring
  let (x, y, z) = tup;

  println!("The value of x is: {}, y is: {}, and z is: {}", x, y, z);
}
```

#### Array

- single chunk of memory allocated on a stack
- type is the same for all elements
- fixed length
- elements are declared within `[]`, and seperated by commas
  - ie: `let a = [1,2,3,4,5,6];`
- data allocated as a stack
- type: `[type; length]`
  - ex: `let a: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];`
- use vector for a dynamically sized array
- accessed using `<name>[<index>]`
  - ex: `let firstElement = a[0];`
- accessing outside of range will compile, but executing with return a panic
  - specific to Rust--not done in low-level languages
