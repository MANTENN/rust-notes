# Packages Crates and Modules

Are a part of Rust scoping system: *Packages*, *Crates*, *Modules*, *path*

> - *Packages* are a Cargo feature that let you build, test, and share crates.
> - *Crates* are a tree of modules that produce a library or executable.
> - *Modules* and the *use* keyword let you control the scope and privacy of paths.
> - A *path* is a way of naming an item such as a struct, function, or module.

## Packages and Crates for Making Libraries and Executables

- crate == binary || library

> - The crate root is a source file that is used to know how to build a crate.
> - A package has a Cargo.toml that describes how to build one or more crates. At most one crate in a package can be a library.

### Packages

`cargo new` creates a package b\c cargo creates `Cargo.toml`

- crate roots
  - `src/main.rs` means binary crate
  - `src/lib.rs` means library create
- `main/lib`  dictate package type
- can contain zero or one library; and at least one binary crate--multiple binaries
  - multiple binary crates are placed into `src/bin`
  - each file indicates a seperate binary crate
- `src/main.rs` & `src/lib.rs` mean the package has two crates: library and binary with the same name

## The Module System to Control Scope and Privacy

Will Cover:

- *Modules* is way to organize code into groups and control the privacy of paths
- *Paths, way to name items
- `use` keyword to bring a path into scope
- `pub` keyword to make items public
- `as` renames items when brought into scope
- Using external packages
- Nested paths to clean up large `use` lists
- > Using the glob operator to clean up large `use` lists
- Module folder structure--How to split modules into individual files

`mod`: to create a module
    - can nest modules

- crate roots form a module named `crate` 
  - modules are accessed via it
  - ex: `use crate:sound:instrument:woodwind`
  - similiar to a filesystem
  
### Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

Path:

- absolute: crate name or `crate` literal
- relative: `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module
- seperated by `::`

### Modules as a Privacy Boundary

- all items(functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private by default
- `pub` to make an item public
- aren't allowed to use private code defined in the modules that are children of the current module
- are allowed to use any code defined in ancestor modules or the current module

### Using the `pub` Keyword to Make Items Public

- doesn't make items inside modules public

### Starting Relative Paths with `super`

- easier to move code into a module scope from root scope

### Using `pub` with Structs and Enums

- adding `pub` before `struct` makes the struct public, not the fields/functions
