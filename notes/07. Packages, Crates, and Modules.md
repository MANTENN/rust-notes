# Packages Crates and Modules

> - Packages are a Cargo feature that let you build, test, and share crates.
> - Crates are a tree of modules that produce a library or executable.
> - Modules and the use keyword let you control the scope and privacy of paths.
> - A path is a way of naming an item such as a struct, function, or module.

## Packages and Crates for Making Libraries and Executables

- crate == binary || library

> - The crate root is a source file that is used to know how to build a crate.
> - A package has a Cargo.toml that describes how to build one or more crates. At most one crate in a package can be a library.
