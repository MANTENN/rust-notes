# Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword

- shorten the calling paths
- similiar to creating a symbolic link
- check for privacy like any other paths
- can be absolute, or relative

- relative paths should begin with `self`

## Creating Idiomatic `use` paths

import the collection, rather than a specific item, this way its easier to distinguish whether a function is local or not.

- solves name conflictions/collisions

## Providing New Names with the `as` keyword

creates a local alias

ex: `use std::io::Result as IoResult`

## Rexporting names with `pub use`

name is private to external modules, to be able to call it, it needs to be rexported with `pub use <path>`

## Using External Packages

add them to cargo config file(`cargo.toml`)

- packages are downloaded from crates.io. Except `std` crate because it is included with the Rust compiler

## Using nested paths to Clean up Large `use` Lists

- reduce to 1 point of failure
- saves vertical space
- common path followed by `::` an then `{<module name>, <module name2>, ...<module name 4>}`
  - ex: `use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};`
  - to include the parent add self to the list
    - ex: `use std::io::{self, Write};` == `use std::io; use std::io::Write;`

## The Glob Operator

brings in all public items into scope
ex: `use std::collections::*;`

used for tests, makes it harder to tell what names are brought into the scope
