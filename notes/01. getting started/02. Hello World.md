# Hello World

* Functions are declared with keyword fn followed by function name, and parameters inside parenthesis
* Main is always first code that is executed
* Curly braces define function body
* `!` before arguments, ex: `println!("Hello, world!")`, calls a macro
* line statements are closed of by a semi-colon

* `.pdb` contains debugging information

* ahead-of-time compiled language
  * people can execute the compiled file without installing a compiler--rust in this case
