# Hello, Cargo!

## Cargo

* Rust's build system, and package manager
* builds, downloads, and builds libaries/dependencies

### Creating a Project

* `cargo new <Folder-Name>` creates a folder, and inside it, this command creates src folder with main.rs file, a toml file, and it initializes a git repo by default--supports other vcs by adding `--vcs` flag
* `Cargo.toml` is config file for dependencies, and crate/package name, and other settings

### Structure

* src files to be stored in `/src/` folder
* root is for README files, license, config, and everything else not related to code

### Building and Running a Cargo Project

* `cargo build` -- creates an executable in `target` rather than current directory
    * running for the first time => creates Cargo.lock--like Package.lock in npm, or yarn
* to execute: `./target/debug/hello_cargo`
* to compile and run `cargo run`
    * will check if files are changed before recompiling, and running
* `cargo check` checks if code compiles, but doesn't make an executable
    * run to periodically check if the program will compile, faster than running `build` b\c executable is not being made

* Commands are cross platform

### Building for release

* `cargo build --release` to compile with optimizations for production applications
    * executable will be generated in `./target/release`
